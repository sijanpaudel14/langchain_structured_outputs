However, when a review goes the extra mile and mentions a team member by name, it creates a genuine connection with potential customers. This personal touch greatly improves the likelihood of customers choosing your business over competitors.

This aspect holds even greater significance in agent-based organizations like salons or real estate companies, where personalized recommendations reassure customers that they will receive individualized care.

See the positive review example below that mentions team members. You can witness this approachâ€™s remarkable impact on building customer trust and fostering satisfaction.
